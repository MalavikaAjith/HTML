  <h1>Greenhouse Effect</h1>
  <p>The greenhouse effect works much the same way on Earth. Gases in the atmosphere,
    such as carbon dioxide, trap heat similar to the glass roof of a greenhouse.</p>
  <h2>Global Warming</h2>
  <p>While the greenhouse effect maintains the temperature, its increase directly translates to rising temperatures<br> As the volume of greenhouse gases is increasing with more burning of fossil fuels, etc, it is contributing to an increase in the planetâ€™s average temperature and climate.</p>
  <h3>Increasing water level</h3>
  <P>Next in line comes the increase in water levels above the safe marks. The logic is quite simple. As the average temperature of the earth is steadily increasing, the polar ice caps are rapidly undergoing a meltdown</P>
  <h4>Destruction of marine life</h4>
  <p>It is a well-known fact that oceans absorb  CO2 and maintain alkalinity. However, the rate at which carbon dioxide is increasing is bad for marine life</p>
